                Late Shree C. K. Pithawala had been the driving force for the
                setting up of the Navyug Vidyabhavan Trust and continuously drawing
                inspiration from him.
              </p>
              <p>
                We proudly take note of his multipronged educational and social
                services rendered selflessly and in the sprint of education.
                This institute of learning in particular, like many others, owes
                a great deal to his vision, understanding and missionary zeal
                right from its inception to its blossoming. This trust has
                been the fruition of his marathon efforts and huge financial aid
                without which this dream would have remained unrealized. His
                contributions in various spheres of Education, Sports, Relief,
                Culture, Health and Religion have been significant and
                praiseworthy.

                Mr. C. K. Pithawallaâ€™s benevolence, charity and philanthropic
                nature, simple humanity and unassuming personality can be
                conspicuously seen in many charitable and humanitarion tasks
                he has carried out, so successfully hugely benefitting the
                people at large. These would have surely remaind unaccomplished
                without the exalted use of wealth at his disposal and spirit of
                selfless service.

                His doing "Karma" without expecting any return or material
                reward or seeking fame out of generous contributions in the
                noble and laudable cause of education is summed up in the
                message of the "Gita" which he has well imbibed. In a true
                Gandhian sense he is a "Trustee" or a "Keeper" of possession
                which he has been using for the benefit of the society. In that
                he is a true votary of Gandhian ideals and values of life.
