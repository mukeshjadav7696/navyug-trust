                      social services rendered selflessly and in the sprint of
                      education. This institute of learning in particular, like
                      many others, owes a great deal to his vision,
                      understanding and missionary zeal right from its inception
                      to its blossoming. This institute has been the fruition of
                      his marathon efforts and huge financial aid without which
                      this dream would have remained

                    Mr. C.K. Pithawallaâ€™s benevolence, charity and philanthropic
                    nature, simple humanity and unassuming personality can be
                    conspicuously seen in many charita- ble and humanitarion
                    tasks he has carried out, so successfully hugely benefitting
                    the people at large. These would have surely remaind
                    unaccomplished without the exalted use of wealth at his
                    disposal and spirit of selfless service.

                    reward or seek- ing fame out of generous contributions in
                    the noble and laudable cause of educa- tion is summed up in
                    the message of the "Gita" which he has well imbibed. In a
                    true Gandhian sense he is a "Trustee" or a "Keeper" of
                    possession which he has been using for the benefit of the
                    society. In that he is a true votary of Gandhian ideals and
                    values of life.
