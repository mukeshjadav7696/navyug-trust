                  Surat is the most industrialized city in the state of Gujarat
                  today. It is well known all over the world for its diamonds,
                  jari and manmade textiles. Situated on the banks of the river
                  Tapti, it is the fastest growing industrial city in the
                  country. Besides this, it is also fast emerging as the source
                  of dyes, chemicals and intermediates, textile machinery,
                  plastic technology and agro-based industries. This attracts
                  skilled, semiskilled and unskilled workmen from all over the
